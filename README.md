<p align="center"> LRF is the mixture of Laravel. It allows to attach Filters, Permissions, Validation and much more with the LRF Controllers (Controllers) as in Django Rest Framework (DRF).

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

I have worked with both Laravel and DRF. I like the why DRF allows to attach and handle Permissions, Filters, Validation and CRUD nicely with views (controllers in Laravel). That is very nice and simple and easy. So getting the idea of using Permissions, Filters, Validation etc, from DRF I decided to make something like that for Laravel. This will help those who are coming from DRF to Laravel or to newbies who are learning Laravel. As after installing this plugin you only need to run (enhanced) artisan command to create LRF Controller, Model, Resource, API Requests (Form Requests) and just write migration add fields in fillable array. You are ready to CRUD with Laravel :-)
Later on you can quite easily add filters, permissions validation and much more.
